## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

## About me
I am an Electrical Engineering student at Arizona State University set to graduate in early 2026. I am interested in software, ML and robotics projects, and always interested in learning something new.

## Highlights
On this profile you'll see a lot of interesting projects. I am always building on what I know and trying to push my capabilities a little bit further. there are basically three types of projects I store on github, large projects that I have done or contribute to (ai smart speaker for example), examples that I build to use as referances later (submodules example) and some of my solutions to leetcode/codewars style challenges.
