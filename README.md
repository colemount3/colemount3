Hello! ðŸ‘‹
About me
I am an Electrical Engineering student at Arizona State University set to graduate in early 2026. I am interested in software, ML, cybersecurity and robotics projects, and always interested in learning something new.

Highlights
On this profile you'll see a lot of interesting projects. I am always building on what I know and trying to push my capabilities a little bit further. There are basically three types of projects I store on GitHub: large projects that I have done or contribute to (AI smart speaker for example), examples that I build to use as references later (submodules example), and some of my solutions to LeetCode/Codewars-style challenges.

Currently the project that I am the most proud of is Cognitive, an app that takes a few short evaluations from the user to determine if they are too impaired to drive.

Ask me about my AI chatbots!
